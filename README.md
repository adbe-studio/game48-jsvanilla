# Game48

A friend of mine invented the game, I coded it ! Game 48 is a local multiplayer dice game based on forecasting your ability to win each round.
The purpose of this app is to show I know my basics and that I am able to deliver clean code using pure javascript.

## Rules of the game
There are 5 dices in the game, respectively a 4, 6, 8, 10 and 20 faces dices.

What a round looks like: <br>
ðŸ‘‰ Roll all dices <br>
ðŸ‘‰ Pick 1 or 2 dices <br>
ðŸ‘‰ Roll again <br>
ðŸ‘‰ Repeat until all dices have been selected
